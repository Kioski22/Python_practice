    # in here the for loop iterated over the range of 1-20 starting from 1 ending before 20 
    # and 2 is the count to be skipped at  (1,3,5,7)
    # n is the variable where the count or the numbers is being stored


#     Starting at 1

#     Stepping by 2

#     Stopping before 20

#     Gives: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
